## Resource Planning Recommendations

1. Critical Path Tasks:
   - Start with Authentication & Security and Core Database Schema
   - Follow with Entry Creation UI and Local Storage
   - Implement Cross-Platform Sync as features become available

2. Parallel Development Opportunities:
   - UI/UX tasks can progress alongside backend infrastructure
   - Theme and customization work can run parallel to core features
   - AI features can be developed independently of core functionality

3. Risk Mitigation:
   - Prioritize early prototyping of sync mechanisms
   - Implement comprehensive testing for authentication
   - Regular security audits throughout development
   - Early accessibility testing to avoid late-stage rework

4. Suggested Team Structure:
   - Core Platform Team: Tasks 1, 2, 5, 6
   - Frontend Team: Tasks 3, 4, 7, 9
   - Security Team: Tasks 3, 5
   - Integration Team: Tasks 6, 12
   - QA/Performance Team: Tasks 13, 15

## Notes
- Most tasks benefit from being broken down into 4-8 subtasks
- High complexity tasks (8-10) should be prioritized for detailed planning
- Consider implementing features incrementally within complex tasks
- Regular testing and validation checkpoints recommended for all high-complexity tasks
