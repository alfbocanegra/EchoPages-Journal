# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement User Authentication and Security
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop secure user authentication with biometric, PIN, and password support.
# Details:
Integrate OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens. Implement biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, Windows Hello, fingerprint). Use platform-specific secure storage (Keychain, KeyStore). Enforce password/PIN complexity. Enable automatic logout.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flows, security features, and error handling. Verify encryption and secure storage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up OAuth 2.0 with JWT Token Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow and configure JWT token issuance and validation for secure user sessions.
### Details:
Register the application with the chosen OAuth provider, configure client IDs and redirect URIs, and implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. Integrate JWT token generation and validation, ensuring tokens are signed and include necessary claims for user identification and session management.

## 2. Implement Secure User Credential Storage and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop secure mechanisms for storing and validating user credentials, including passwords and PINs, using platform-specific secure storage.
### Details:
Use platform-specific secure storage solutions (e.g., iOS Keychain, Android KeyStore, Windows Credential Locker) to store sensitive user credentials. Apply strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) for passwords and PINs before storage. Implement credential validation logic during login and registration.

## 3. Integrate Biometric Authentication Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Add support for biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, Windows Hello, fingerprint) as a login option, leveraging device APIs.
### Details:
Utilize platform-specific biometric APIs to enroll and authenticate users via biometrics. Store biometric authentication tokens securely and link them to user accounts. Provide fallback to PIN/password if biometric authentication fails or is unavailable.

## 4. Enforce Password and PIN Complexity Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement and validate password and PIN complexity rules during user registration and credential updates.
### Details:
Define and enforce rules for minimum length, character variety, and disallowed patterns for passwords and PINs. Integrate real-time validation in registration and update forms, and provide user feedback on compliance.

## 5. Enable Automatic Logout and Session Expiry [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement automatic logout and session expiration mechanisms to enhance security and privacy.
### Details:
Configure session timeouts and inactivity detection. Invalidate JWT tokens and clear sensitive data from memory and secure storage upon logout or expiry. Notify users of session expiration and require re-authentication.

## 6. Conduct Security and Privacy Review with Penetration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Perform a comprehensive security review and penetration testing to ensure authentication flows, storage, and privacy requirements are met.
### Details:
Review code for vulnerabilities, conduct penetration testing on authentication endpoints, and validate compliance with privacy requirements from the PRD. Address any identified issues and document security measures.
