# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Cross-Platform Synchronization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement real-time, secure synchronization of journal entries across devices.
# Details:
Use WebSocket connections for real-time updates. Implement operational transformation for conflict resolution. Integrate with iCloud, Google Drive, OneDrive. Support offline sync and bandwidth optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Test sync across devices, conflict resolution, and offline scenarios. Validate sync status indicators.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up WebSocket infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the WebSocket connection framework for real-time bidirectional communication between client devices and the server
### Details:
Implement WebSocket server endpoints and client connection handlers. Configure connection pooling, heartbeat mechanisms, and reconnection strategies. Ensure proper authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections. This will serve as the foundation for real-time updates across platforms.

## 2. Implement data serialization and transformation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create efficient data serialization mechanisms for journal entries to minimize bandwidth usage during synchronization
### Details:
Utilize protocol buffers for structured data serialization to reduce bandwidth usage by up to 30% compared to JSON. Design transformation pipelines to handle different data formats across platforms. Implement versioning for data models to manage updates effectively.

## 3. Develop operational transformation for conflict resolution [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement conflict resolution mechanisms to handle concurrent edits to the same journal entry from different devices
### Details:
Implement operational transformation algorithms to resolve conflicts when multiple users edit the same content. Use Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to enable concurrent updates without conflicts. Apply consistent timestamping to track the latest changes across platforms. Design merge strategies for different types of journal content.

## 4. Integrate with cloud storage providers [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Develop integration modules for iCloud, Google Drive, and OneDrive to enable cross-platform synchronization
### Details:
Create abstraction layers for each cloud provider's API. Implement authentication flows for each service. Develop file management operations (create, read, update, delete) for each provider. Ensure proper error handling and retry mechanisms for API failures. Implement storage quota management.

## 5. Implement offline synchronization capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Develop mechanisms to handle journal edits while devices are offline and synchronize when connectivity is restored
### Details:
Create a local database for storing offline changes. Implement change tracking with sequence numbers or vector clocks. Design queue management for pending synchronization operations. Develop conflict detection and resolution for offline changes. Implement bandwidth-aware sync strategies that prioritize critical data.

## 6. Optimize bandwidth usage and performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Implement strategies to minimize data transfer and optimize synchronization performance across different network conditions
### Details:
Implement delta synchronization to transfer only changed portions of journal entries. Create compression algorithms for different content types. Develop adaptive sync intervals based on network conditions and battery status. Implement background synchronization to avoid impacting user experience. Set up caching mechanisms to reduce redundant transfers.

## 7. Develop monitoring and diagnostics system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive monitoring system to track synchronization health, detect issues, and provide diagnostics for troubleshooting
### Details:
Implement logging for sync operations across all platforms. Create metrics collection for sync performance and error rates. Develop a dashboard for visualizing sync status and health. Implement automatic retry mechanisms for failed requests. Create user-facing sync status indicators and troubleshooting tools. Set up alerts for critical sync failures.
